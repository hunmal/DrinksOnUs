In todayâ€™s society drinks at bars or restaurants are way too overpriced. In reality, many people already have the necessary ingredients for the cocktails at home. Drinks On Us seeks to remedy this by offering a cocktail and mocktail search engine where users input the contents of their liqour cabinents and receive back cocktail or mocktail recipes.
